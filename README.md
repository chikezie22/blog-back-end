## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure Firebase:

2. Enable Email/Password authentication in the Authentication section.
3. Set up a Firestore database to store blog post data.
4. Copy your Firebase configuration credentials.
5. Create an environment file (e.g., `environment.ts`) in the `src/environments` directory with your Firebase configuration.

   ```typescript
   export const environment = {
     production: false,
     firebase: {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
     }
   };
   ```
